# A Simple Version of DQN Flappy Bird in mxnet (Nature version)

## Overview
This project follows the description of the Deep Q Learning algorithm described in [2]. Comparing to DQN algorithm in [1], **the target net(used to caculate the target Q value) was periodically update ** rather than updated each step

## Dependency:
* Python 2.7
* mxnet
* pygame
* OpenCV-Python

sudo apt-get install python-pygame
## Usage

- download the source code

```
git clone https://github.com/foolyc/DQN-FlappyBird-mxnet
```

- train the model 


```
python flappybird.py train -p './snapshot/pre.params'
```

- play the game with a pretrained model file

```
python flappybird.py test -p './snapshot/pre.params'
```

- configuration

```
FLG_GPU = True # using gpu or cpu
GAME = 'bird' # the name of the game being played for log files
ACTIONS = 2 # number of valid actions
GAMMA = 0.99 # decay rate of past observations
OBSERVE = 100. # timesteps to observe before training
EXPLORE = 2000000. # frames over which to anneal epsilon
FINAL_EPSILON = 0.0000 # final value of epsilon
INITIAL_EPSILON = 0.1 # starting value of epsilon
REPLAY_MEMORY = 50000 # number of previous transitions to remember
BATCH = 32 # size of minibatch
FRAME_PER_ACTION = 1 # number of frames to skip
FRAME = 4 # number of past frames to use as the input data of the q net
HEIGHT = 80 # height of input image
WIDTH = 80 # width of input image
UPDATE_STEP = 100 # target net updating period
SAVE_STEP = 10000 # saving the params per step period
```
